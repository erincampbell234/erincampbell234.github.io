## About:

_(She/Her)_

I am a public health researcher interested in how economic policy, environmental exposure, and long-term health intersect at the community level. I am particularly interested in these topics as they relate to extractive industries like oil and gas. 

I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2021 with a B.A. in Economics, a B.S. in Environmental Health, and a minor in Applied Statistics. 

For a year and a half after graduating, I worked as a Research Analyst at Resources for the Future (RFF), a nonpartisan environmental economics think-tank in Washington, DC. I spent 8 months as a full-time Research Assistant at Boston University, working with on a NIH funded project that investigates reproductive health equity, and oil and gas development associated with the PRESTO study and Mary Willis PhD. I continue to contribute to this project part-time through my graudate studies. 

At GWU, I have become involved as a research assistant in the GW Air, Climate, and Health Lab (PI: Susan Anenberg, PhD), where I have worked on projects ranging from systematic review to commentary on energy policy modelling. Additionally, I have served as the teaching assistant (2024 and 2025) for Sustainable Energy and Environmental Health, an upper level undergraduate course taught by Dan Goldberg, PhD. 

I am currently writing my master's thesis on oil and gas development and adverse birth outcomes, co-advised by Mary Willis, PhD (BU) and Jordan Kuiper PhD (GWU).
