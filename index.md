## About:

_(She/Her)_

I am an aspiring public health researcher interested in how economic policy, environmental exposure, and long-term health intersect at the community level.

I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2021 with a B.A. in Economics, a B.S. in Environmental Health, and a minor in Applied Statistics. 

For a year and a half after graduating, I worked as a Research Analyst at Resources for the Future (RFF), a nonpartisan environmental economics think-tank in Washington, DC. I spent 8 months as a full-time Research Assistant at Boston University, working with on a NIH funded project that investigates reproductive health equity, and oil and gas development associated with the PRESTO study and Mary Willis PhD.
