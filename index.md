## About:

_(She/Her)_

I am an aspiring public health researcher interested in how economic policy, environmental exposure, and long-term health intersect at the community level.

I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2021 with a B.A. in Economics, a B.S. in Environmental Health, and a minor in Applied Statistics. 

Since then, I've been working as a Research Analyst at Resources for the Future (RFF), a nonpartisan environmental economics think-tank in Washington, DC.  

I currently an applicant to MPH programs.
